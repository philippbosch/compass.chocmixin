# Compass mixin for Chocolat

This mixin enables compilation of [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) projects in [Chocolat](http://chocolatapp.com).

## Requirements

 * Chocolat 1.3 greater

## Installation

In Chocolat simply go to **Actions â€º Install Mixins** and check
the **compass** item.

## Usage

Compass compilation is invoked automatically every time you save a 
`.scss` file using the `Cmd-S` shortcut. The mixin looks for a 
`config.rb` in the current or a parent directory. If compilation 
succeeds, a notification is displayed (OSX 10.8 only). If an error 
happens, a popover with the output from the compass binary is shown.
